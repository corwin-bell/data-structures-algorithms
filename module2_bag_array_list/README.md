# Module 2: More Bags
In this second assignment, you will extend the functionality of the Java bag data structure by implementing additional methods. You will add methods for calculating the size of the bag, merging two bags together, and finding the distinct elements in the bag.

Modify the `Bag` class from the previous assignment to include the following additional methods:
`int size()`: This method should return the total number of elements in the bag, including duplicates.
 `void merge(Bag<T> otherBag)`: This method should merge the elements of `otherBag` into the current bag.
 `Bag<T> distinct()`: This method should return a new bag that contains only the distinct elements from the current bag.
Write a Java program that demonstrates the usage of the additional methods. Your program should perform the following operations:
Create two instances of the `Bag` class.
Add elements to each bag, including duplicates.
Print the size of each bag using the `size` method.
Merge the two bags together using the `merge` method.
Print the merged bag contents.
Create a new bag containing only the distinct elements using the `distinct` method.
Print the distinct bag contents.
Submit your completed assignment as a .java source code file.
